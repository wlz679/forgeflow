  faq: [
    { q: 'What is a good profit margin for freelance projects?', a: 'Aim for 40-60% gross margin. This gives you a healthy buffer for scope creep, revisions, and non-billable time spent on admin, marketing, and professional development. Margins below 20% are risky — one mistake can flip the project into a loss.' },
    { q: 'What does effective hourly rate mean?', a: 'Your effective hourly rate is the total project fee divided by estimated hours. It tells you what you actually earn per hour. If your effective rate is $125/hr but you bill at $75/hr, you are either underestimating hours or undercharging. Track this across all projects to find your real earning power.' },
    { q: 'Should I include my tools and software subscriptions in costs?', a: 'For project-level profitability, include only costs directly attributable to this project (stock photos, subcontractors, specific software). Overhead costs like your general Adobe subscription or internet bill should be factored into your overall business profitability, not individual project margins.' },
    { q: 'How do I handle scope creep on fixed-price projects?', a: 'Define project scope in writing before starting. Include the number of revisions, deliverables, and what constitutes extra work. When scope expands, issue a change order with additional pricing immediately — do not wait until the project ends.' },
    { q: 'What if my effective hourly rate is lower than expected?', a: 'This usually means you are underestimating hours. Track actual vs estimated time for 3 projects to find your estimation bias. If you consistently spend 30% more time than estimated, increase your price by 30% or improve your scoping process.' },
